# **App Name**: ConveyorGuard

## Core Features:

- Initial Reference Setup: Automatically establishes initial reference data for conveyor belt alignment using sensor inputs.
- Anomaly Detection: Detects conveyor belt slippage or misalignment with deviations of 2mm or greater.
- Real-time Monitoring: Provides live monitoring of conveyor belt status with a dashboard displaying key metrics and alerts.
- Automated Logging: Records instances of abnormal line slippage with timestamps and deviation magnitudes.
- Alerting System: Sends real-time notifications upon detection of abnormal conveyor belt slippage or misalignment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) to evoke a sense of trust, stability, and technological sophistication in line with industrial applications.
- Background color: Light Blue-Gray (#F0F4F8), providing a neutral backdrop that reduces eye strain and enhances readability.
- Accent color: Yellow-Orange (#D97706) to draw attention to alerts, actionable items, and key data points, promoting swift operator responses.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a modern, clean, and highly legible appearance, ideal for data-rich industrial interfaces.
- Use clear, utilitarian icons to represent conveyor belt components, sensor data, and system status. Icons should be monochrome with a subtle highlight in the accent color to indicate activity or alerts.
- Dashboard layout emphasizes critical real-time data (belt alignment, deviation metrics) in a clear, structured format. Alert notifications are prominently displayed. Visualizations such as trend graphs support at-a-glance analysis.
- Subtle animations, such as a progress bar during initial reference setup or a flashing indicator upon alert, provide essential feedback without overwhelming the user. Use sparingly to maintain focus on the monitoring task.
